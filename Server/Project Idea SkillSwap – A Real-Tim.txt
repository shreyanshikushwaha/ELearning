Project Idea: "SkillSwap" – A Real-Time Knowledge Exchange Platform 🚀
Problem Statement:
Many people want to learn new skills (coding, music, fitness, etc.) but lack affordable, real-time guidance. Current platforms either have pre-recorded courses (lacking interaction) or expensive live classes.
Solution: A real-time skill exchange platform where users can teach or learn skills via live video, chat, and collaboration. Payments, AI-based tutor matching, and real-time analytics make it scalable.

🔹 Core Features & Tech Involvement
1. WebSockets: Real-Time Learning Sessions
Users can join instant 1-on-1 or group sessions with a WebSocket-powered chat.
Live collaboration (code editor for coding lessons, shared whiteboard for design).
Push notifications for session updates.

2. Advanced Authentication & Security
Role-based access (Learners, Mentors, Admins).
OAuth2 (Google, Facebook Login).
JWT with refresh tokens.
2FA for mentors (extra security for paid tutors).

3. Aggregation Pipeline (Analytics & Reports)
Most popular skills & tutors based on ratings.
Mentor earnings & student spending reports.
Session duration & retention tracking.
Chat sentiment analysis (detect good/bad feedback).

4. Payment Gateway Integration
Stripe/PayPal integration for secure payments.
Wallet system (Users can load credits, pay per session).
Subscription model (Monthly access to premium mentors).
Escrow system (Funds held until session completion).

5. AI Chatbot (NLP-based)
Suggests the best mentor based on user interests.
Answers basic questions before connecting to a human mentor.
Provides session summaries after each lesson.

6. Intermediate System Design & Scalability
Microservices architecture:
User Service (Auth, Profiles)
Chat Service (WebSocket, Messages)
Payment Service (Transactions, Subscriptions)
Analytics Service (Reports, AI-driven insights)
RabbitMQ for event-driven architecture (e.g., session reminders).
Redis caching (For quick mentor lookups, chat history).

7. High-Level Backend
GraphQL for efficient data fetching (or REST API with pagination).
Rate limiting & DDOS protection.
Database replication & sharding (for scaling).
Background jobs (e.g., send payment invoices, email reports).

8. Schema Design
Users (name, email, role, wallet balance).
Sessions (mentor, student, duration, payment status).
Chat messages (sender, receiver, timestamps).
Payments (user ID, amount, method, status).
Reviews & Ratings (mentor ID, student feedback).

🔹 Tech Stack
Backend:
✅ Node.js + TypeScript (for type safety).
✅ Express.js (API & WebSocket handling).
✅ MongoDB (Mongoose) (NoSQL for flexibility).
✅ Redis (Caching).
✅ RabbitMQ/Kafka (Event-driven messaging).

Frontend:
✅ React.js (Next.js for SEO-friendly pages).
✅ Socket.io (For WebSocket-based chat & collaboration).
✅ TailwindCSS (Modern UI design).

Deployment:
✅ Docker & Kubernetes (Containerization & Scaling).
✅ CI/CD (GitHub Actions/Jenkins).
✅ AWS/GCP/Firebase (Cloud Functions for background tasks).

💡 Why This Project?
✅ Real-world scalability – Can be extended to different domains (coding, fitness, music).
✅ Covers key backend concepts (WebSocket, Authentication, Payments, Aggregation Pipeline).
✅ AI + Microservices – Learning advanced backend & system design.
✅ Monetizable – Can be turned into a real business!
